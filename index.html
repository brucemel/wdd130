            <p> Hello! my name is Bruce MelÃ©ndez and I from Cajamarca, Peru. 
                I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
                since I was 13 years old. I served a mission in the Peru Lima West Mission. 
                I enjoy doing many things, including riding bicycles, driving cars, spending time 
                with friends and family, watching movies, and I also like anime.
                I have a hobby that is being able to take photographs of landscapes, 
                I have had the opportunity to travel to some places in Peru and 
                I have not missed the opportunity to take as many photos as possible. 
                I am currently 21 years old and every day I learn about life and its challenges.</p>
