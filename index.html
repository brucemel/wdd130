                <p> Hello! my name is Bruce MelÃ©ndez and I from Cajamarca, Peru. 
                    I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
                    since I was 13 years old. I served a mission in the Peru Lima West Mission. 
                    I enjoy doing many things, including riding bicycles, driving cars, spending time 
                    with friends and family, watching movies, and I also like anime.
                    I have a hobby that is being able to take photographs of landscapes, 
                    I have had the opportunity to travel to some places in Peru and 
                    I have not missed the opportunity to take as many photos as possible. 
                    I am currently 21 years old and every day I learn about life and its challenges.</p>

                <p>Lake ParÃ³n is the largest lake in the Cordillera Blanca, on the Peruvian Andes, 32 km E from the city Caraz, originally at 4,185 m (13,730 ft) asl, now at 4,155 m (13,632 ft) asl.
                    ParÃ³n Lagoon is a stunning glacial lake located in the Huaylas province, 
                    Ancash region, in central Peru, near the city of Huaraz. Here are some details about Laguna ParÃ³n: 
                    before planning your visit, it's advisable to check road conditions and weather, 
                    as the region can experience abrupt changes due to its altitude and geographical location. 
                    Additionally, it's recommended to take necessary precautions to acclimatize to the altitude 
                    before engaging in strenuous physical activities in the area.
